# Add Two Integers

Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, return the **sum** of the two integers.

## Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: num1 = 10, num2 = 6
Output: 16

Explanation: num1 is 10, num2 is 6, and their sum is 10 + 6 = 16. So the returned value is 16.
```

## Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: num1 = -12, num2 = 4
Output: -8

Explanation: num1 is -12, num2 is 4, and their sum is -12 + 4 = -8. So the returned value is -8.
```

## Constraints:

 - `-100 <= num1`, `num2 <= 100`
 - num1 and num2 are both integers.
 - The sum of num1 and num2 will be in the range of -200 to 200.
