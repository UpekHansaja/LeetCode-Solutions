## Difficulty Levels

The problems in this repository are categorized into three difficulty levels:

- **Easy**: These problems are designed to be straightforward and are suitable for beginners. They typically involve basic algorithms and data structures.

- **Medium**: These problems require a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures. They often involve more complex logic and problem-solving skills.

- **Hard**: These problems are challenging and are intended for advanced programmers. They often require sophisticated algorithms and a strong grasp of computer science concepts.

Each difficulty level is organized into its own directory within the repository, making it easy to navigate and find problems that match your skill level.

## Problems

The repository contains a variety of problems categorized by difficulty level. Each problem is stored in its respective directory (Easy, Medium, Hard) and includes the following components:

- **Problem Statement**: A detailed description of the problem, including input and output specifications.

- **Example Cases**: Sample inputs and outputs to illustrate how the problem works.

- **Constraints**: Any limitations or conditions that apply to the problem.

- **Java Solution**: A Java implementation of the solution to the problem, complete with comments and explanations.

Each problem directory follows a consistent structure to ensure ease of use and understanding. Users can navigate through the directories to find problems of interest, study the provided solutions, and implement their own versions for practice.

Each problem directory typically contains the following files:
- `README.md`: Contains the problem statement, example cases, and constraints.
- `Solution.java`: Contains the Java implementation of the solution.

### Example Problem Structure

Each problem directory contains a `README.md` file that outlines the problem statement, example cases, and constraints. Below is an example structure for a problem titled "Add Two Integers":

```markdown
# Add Two Integers
Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, return the **sum** of the two integers.

## Example 1:

Input: num1 = 10, num2 = 6
Output: 16
Explanation: num1 is 10, num2 is 6, and their sum is 10 + 6 = 16. So the returned value is 16.

## Example 2:

Input: num1 = -12, num2 = 4
Output: -8
Explanation: num1 is -12, num2 is 4, and their sum is -12 + 4 = -8. So the returned value is -8.


## Constraints:

 - `-100 <= num1`, `num2 <= 100`
 - num1 and num2 are both integers.
 - The sum of num1 and num2 will be in the range of -200 to 200.

```
